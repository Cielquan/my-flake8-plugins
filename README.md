# my-flake8-plugins

Just a dummy repo with all the [flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8) plugins I use with
[flakeheaven](https://github.com/flakeheaven/flakeheaven) managed by
[poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) for dependency compatibility.

The repo also contains a base config for `flakeheaven`.
